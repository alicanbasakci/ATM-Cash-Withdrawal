As you can see, there are two files with the .py extension. The OnlyCode.py file contains the functionality of the ATM system and the CodeWithUI.py file includes the code that integrates the ATM system with a UI design. To ensure the code works correctly, you need to set the ASSETS_PATH. Please download the file named "build" and configure the file path at line 22, as shown in the example.
